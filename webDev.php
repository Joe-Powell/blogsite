<h1>C.R.U.D. Project made with Php, a basic social media site.</h1> 
<div class="overlay">

    <h4>Register an Account, Log in, Leave a post if logged in, be able to 
    edit your post if it's the same user, Upload photos, and much more. This
     is a project I made while learning the basics of C.R.U.D which stands for
      Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This project is not so much about the 
      visual exprience, but what it can do with the data entered into a database.
